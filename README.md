# Comparative-Performance-Analysis-of-Tournament-Branch-Predictor-and-perceptron-Branch-Predictor
I worked on a project focused on enhancing processor performance by designing and analyzing branch predictors. The project involved implementing an Alpha Branch Predictor, which uses a combination of local and global branch history to improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, I designed a Perceptron Branch Predictor, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict branches by dynamically learning patterns in instruction streams. Both designs were evaluated for accuracy, latency, and hardware complexity, providing insights into their trade-offs and applicability in modern processor architectures
